=============================================================

This codes describes the implementation of the goalsolve and goalminsolve tools
as described in [Giorgini, Mylopoulous & Sebastiani, submitted to ER03].

This is the first public release of the source code for goalsolve and goalminsolve. This
code is a preliminary version. This version shall only be regarded as a
prototype. I don't have any documentations. But if you have any 
questions about it, you can ask me and I will try to answer to them ASAP.

Because this is basically a development snapshot, it may have some redundent 
data structures and all kinds of useless staff. I particular, as both  
time efficiency and memory usage of the encoder are not relevant issues, 
I did not optimize them, and it may be the case that there are some memory 
leaks around.

You should have no problem to compile it under x86 Linux using g++. 
I tried no other platform. The code is fairly simple, and basically implemented what
was discribed in the paper. 

Goalsolve calls the SAT solver chaff by Lintao Zhang from Princeton University.
(http://ee.princeton.edu/~lintaoz/)
Chaff is called as a linux command, and the dialogue between Goalsolver and chaff 
is performed via files. The correctness of Goalsolver relies on that of chaff. 
Goalsolver recognizes the output of the chaff version 2001.6.15.
(whose code can be found in the directory "Chaff"). For different versions of chaff,
it may be the case that one has to readapt the decoder (file decoder.cc). 

Similarly, Goalminsolve calls the Minweight SAT solver MinWeight by Paolo Liberatore 
from University of Rome (http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~liberato/mindp/).
MinWeight is called as a linux command, and the dialogue between Goalsolver and MinWeight 
is performed via files. The correctness of Goalsolver relies on that of MinWeight. 

In order to make Goalminsolve recognizes the output of MinWeight, I've slightly modified 
the output routines of minweight in the file minweight.c.
To see the modification done, you can go in the Minweight directory and digit:

Goalminsolve recognizes the output of the current (March 13th 2003) version of of Minweight
(whose code can be found in the directory "Minweight"). For different versions of Minweight,
it may be the case that one has to modify the minweight.c as above and possibly readapt the decoder
 (file decoder.cc).

EVERYTHING IN THIS VERSION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. So, don't be surprised
if next version don't have some of the options and/or have uncompatible
functions. It's only served as a demontration.

Known potential problems: 

1. The parser does not check the syntax very strictly.
Thus, if the input has wrong format, the solver may generate problems.

2. Some counters may overflow for (VERY) big examples. If so, change the constants in
goal.h and graph.h.

Please report bugs and feedback to rseba@dit.unitn.it.

REMARK: 
Before starting using the tool, you must modify the string "chaffcommand" in config.h 
in order to tell the system the absoulte path of executable file of chaff. 

To install, 
- go into Chaff and Minweight directories and type "make"
- go into Goalsolve directory and type "make"
> "make"        ==> generates both goalsolve and goalminsolve
> "make clean"  ==> removes goalsove, goalminsolve and object files
